# Linear Neural Network Model to Classify Opioid Industry Documents
## Rena Liu working under Dr. Anqi Liu | JHU Computer Science
## Spring 2022

### Background
The goal of this project is to classify industry documents related to the U.S. opioid epidemic into classes of document type (legal, report, publication, graph, etc.) to support legal and social research regarding the epidemic.

As a proof of concept, I spent the Spring 2022 semester (January to September) implementing a simple linear neural network (NN) model which classifies the document title of tobacco industry documents.
